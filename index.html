  I don't know yet what this blog is gonna be all about but I'm getting started with some deep learning blog posts for now. I most likely won't be writing tutorials or articles on the already popular stuff. I'd like to write about research works that intrigue me. Sometimes I'll pick some random papers without a common theme, other times some papers which do have something in common. Let's see how this goes and what I feel like after first couple of articles.
