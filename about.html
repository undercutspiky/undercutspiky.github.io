    I'm <span class="text-red-700">D</span>hanan<span class="text-red-700">jay</span>,
    but everyone just calls me <span class="text-red-700">DJay</span>. I'm originally from a small town in western
    Uttar Pradesh, India. But Delhi is the place where I spent my teenage years and consider it to be my home.
    From Delhi, I moved to Switzerland to pursue my Master's and then to Germany for my current job and have been
    here since then.

  <p class="mb-2">
    I have a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Computer Science. I specialise in this thing called Deep Learning
    which you might know as Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence. I know that technically these three terms
    are three different things! Jeez!.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-2">
    I have lots of interests of which I spend time on some. These include but are not limited to - running,
    gymming(weight training), Physics, dancing, reading, Science(in general) and so on.
